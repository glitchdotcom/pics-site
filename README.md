## Clone your own to try Fastly

You can make your own version of this site and add your own pics to try with Fastly Image Optimizer:

* Clone the repo
* In your repo **Settings** select **Pages**
* Choose **Deploy from branch** and select the `main` branch
* **Save** and GitHub will publish your site
* Grab the address which will end `github.io`

Create a Fastly service with your GitHub Pages site as the origin...
